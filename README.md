### Abstract
ðŸ“– **LitLovers** is a book information application providing the most up-to-date list of top-rated books by the NY Times. Users are able to scroll through these books, search books of interest and view more details on the book after clicking on books of interest. Users are also able to buy the book with one easy click, linking to independent book stores. 

The target user for this application are individuals who are readers with very busy lives, yet want to keep up-to-date with current popular books. I also wanted to support Indepdent book stores, so I created an easy buy link. If the user would like additional information, the user can click on the book cover and be presented with a synposis, current rant, weeks on best seller list, and synopsis. 

### Context

This project was created in three days to apply for **Scribd**.  I wanted to showcase my passion for reading, as well as my experience and knowledge with the technologies specified in the job description.
